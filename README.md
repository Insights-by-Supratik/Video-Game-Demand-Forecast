## Video Game Demand Forecast

This project explores the effectiveness of machine learning and econometric models in forecasting video game sales across various regions. By comparing models such as Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the study assesses their predictive accuracy and ability to capture the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in video game sales data. The findings indicate that while traditional econometric models like LR provide a foundational understanding of sales dynamics, they struggle to match the precision and adaptability of advanced machine learning models. ANN emerged as the most accurate model overall, particularly excelling in North American and European data, while RF showed strong performance in Japanese data and the Rest of the World. The research suggests a strategic approach to model selection based on the stage of game development, with LR being more useful during the planning and design phases and machine learning models becoming essential for refining sales strategies. These insights offer valuable contributions to the video game industry, highlighting the need for sophisticated forecasting techniques in an increasingly complex market.
